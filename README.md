# SoftwareDesignDocument

Software design document I created for a client, The Gaming Room. The design document demonstrates my ability to be effective in working through the design of a software application and to communicate it effectively to a client and my development team member.

# Summary 

The Gaming Room wants to develop a multi-platform supported web-based game.  The name of the game is “Draw It or Lose It” and is currently available as an Android app only. The game consists of four rounds that last one minute each. The drawings are pulled from a large library of stock drawings as clues. The current team will guess until the timer runs out. If the current team doesn’t correctly guess the puzzle in the allotted time frame, the remaining teams are allowed one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit. 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I did particularly well in determining the solutions needed to accomadate the software needs of The Gaming Room. Additionally, I explained pros and cons of various scenarious to validate the reasoning of the selected choices. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The process of working through a design document helped when devloping the code by providing structured and predetermined solutions to implement. The choices were deemed the most optimal in the design document which allowed for an easy transition to the code. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would choose the selection of operating platform. I would improve this section by further expanding on how Windows could eventually be the cheapest option in the end.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs and implemented them into my software design by outlining the constraints. Once the constraints were outlined, I developed solutions around them. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they will be the ones playing the game. Considering their needs will lead to a smoother design process and will require less revision.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing the software first by understanding the client's wants and determining the game's constraints. This allowed me to understand how and what implementations were needed in code to achieve the end product. Strategies I would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application is seeking other developer's opinions and developing pseudo code.
